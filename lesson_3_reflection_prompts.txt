Q- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A- I'd use a remote repository if I was working on something that I wanted public or shared.


Q- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A- Git could possibly interfere with what you are doing if it's automatically synching your local repository with the remote repository


Q- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A- 	Forking only exists within Github. It is not a feature of git. I'd use this if I would like Github to copy a repo and add it to my Github account while linking what I've copied to its source.
	Cloning creates a copy of a repository. It acts on a repo. I'd use this if I'd like to copy a repo to my local machine
	Branches create separate 'HEAD's that divert away from the master. I'd use this when I would like to add a new experimental feature while keeping the main branch intact.


Q- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A- Allows you to keep track of changes to your local copy against the remote copy


Q- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A- By using some other collaboration tools. For instance, Slack. However, Git and GitHub are built for code and collaboration and it would be difficult for other methods to match what git and Github do. Being able to see and add comments to changes would be harder. Having a view or actual copy of the modified files would also be made more difficult for the collaborators. It is difficult at the moment to think of what would be easier about collaborating with other methods.
