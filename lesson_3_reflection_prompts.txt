Q- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A- I'd use a remote repository if I was working on something that I wanted public or shared.


Q- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A- Git could possibly interfere with what you are doing if it's automatically synching your local repository with the remote repository


Q- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A- 	Forking only exists within Github. It is not a feature of git. I'd use this if I would like Github to copy a repo and add it to my Github account while linking what I've copied to its source.
	Cloning creates a copy of a repository. It acts on a repo. I'd use this if I'd like to copy a repo to my local machine
	Branches create separate 'HEAD's that divert away from the master. I'd use this when I would like to add a new experimental feature while keeping the main branch intact.


Q- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A- Allows you to keep track of changes to your local copy against the remote copy
